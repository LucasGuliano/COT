/*
Command confirmation file. This can be used to associate each command
with information on how to confirm its successful execution. The info
is printed on the tohban's console after executing the command if the
command is executed in a real sequence.

Each command/confirmation appears like this:

CMD: MDP_XRT_QT_PROG_SET
One or more lines of confirming text

The space after the colon is mandatory. The lines following, until
the next CMD: line, are generated into the ORL file as comment
lines. If there are multiple lines in the confirmation, each
appears as a separate comment line in the ORL. Only the last line
pauses.

input:

CMD: MDP_XRT_CTRL_MANU
MDP_XRT_CTRL_MODE MANU OK/NG
CMD: XRT_FSA_CONTROL
If this command requests status, check S_FSA_STATUS_VAL against
User's Manual table 9-3.


Example output fragment:

	CMD : MDP_XRT_CTRL_MANU ;
	C. : "MDP_XRT_CTRL_MODE MANU OK/NG" ;
	/* Select obs program XRTPRG-1211.xml as main program */
	CMD : MDP_XRT_QT_PROG_SET 09 ;
	CMD : XRT_FSA_CONTROL 44 00 00 ; /* FW1StepCCWToTarget */
	NP_C. : "If this command requests status, check S_FSA_STATUS_VAL against" ;
	C. : "User's Manual table 9-3." ;

This approach is experimental and may change later.
